# Getting Started with The Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get spin up this project on your local machine you need a good internet connection and node.js installed. 

1. Open a new terminal in the root of this project and run `npx yarn install`, if you do not have yarn then run `npm install yarn`, finally spin up a development server with `npx yarn run start` - localhost3000.

2. To run test, in your terminal at the root of this project run `npx yarn run test`.

# Reason for specific design and interfaces

1. React Redux is a production standard state management tool, it offers devTools in the browser, useful toolkit methods and hooks for nifty performance enhancements, middleWare for async operations and its implmentation structure makes state management easy to use. 

2. Material UI library, easy to use, good looking UI components, its a respected and well used library, and fully responsive out the box. 

3. Typescript - Declaring types on components, functions and almost all moving parts of the app helps prevent me from making errors during development, I am also able to get autoComplete hints when I type. 

# Obstacles

I found the redux implimentation style, and declaring types for most moving parts of the codebase quite time costly.

# Resources used

API Mocker -- https://mswjs.io/
UI Lib - Material UI
State Management - Redux + Redux Middleware

# If I had more time

I would improve the look and feel, integrated es-lint and used redux toolkit.

# Time spent

I spent 7h on the project, I added in some extras over and above the brief and I think one needs to take into account that I was using typescript to type check most of the codebase, I would in future rather have used redux toolkit for faster development.

# Playing with the application. 

There is a lack of data on alot of the deal items, lookup `Felix The Reaper` to get enough data to see all features functioning.
