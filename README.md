# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get spin up this project on your local machine you need a good interent connection and node.js installed on your machine. 

1. Open a new terminal in the root of this project and run `npm i --force` ( Certain packages require older version of React, here we are using a new version of React and in order to by-pass this complaint from Node Package Managers we need to add the flag `--force`, this is unlikely to cause any errors in our application as the required versions from pacakges are mere suggestions and hard requirements!)
