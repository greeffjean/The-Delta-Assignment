# Getting Started with The Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get spin up this project on your local machine you need a good interent connection and node.js installed on your machine. 

1. Open a new terminal in the root of this project and run `npx yarn install`, if you do not have yarn then run `npm install yarn`.

2. To run test in your terminal at the root of this project run `npx yarn run test`.

# Reason for specific design and interfaces

1. React Redux is a production standard state management tool, it offers devTools, powerful toolkit modules for nifty performance enancements, middleWare for async operations and its implmentation structure makes state management easy. 

2. Material UI library, easy to use, good looking UI Templates, its a respected and well used library, and fully responsive out the box. 

3. Typescript - Typing components, functions and almost everything helps prevent my from making errors during development, also able to get autoComplete hints when I type. 

# Obstacles

At times there was some complexity with conflicting and mismatching types on component props, creating and reusing a type directory helps me to recognise and reuse types with ease. 

Some old tricks Ive learned worth mentioning is debouncing functions for input searchBoxes that make API calls on typing.

# Time spent

I spent quite a while on this, 7h, without Typescript I could have done it in 5h, and if I was not using redux maybe 4h. 

I always work as fast I can but I don't believe in cutting corners, I strive for quality!
