# Getting Started with The Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get spin up this project on your local machine you need a good interent connection and node.js installed on your machine. 

1. Open a new terminal in the root of this project and run `npx yarn install`, if you do not have yarn then run `npm install yarn`, finally spin up a development server with `npx yarn run start` - localhost3000.

2. To run test in your terminal at the root of this project run `npx yarn run test`.

# Reason for specific design and interfaces

1. React Redux is a production standard state management tool, it offers devTools, powerful toolkit modules for nifty performance enhancements, middleWare for async operations and its implmentation structure makes state management easy to use. 

2. Material UI library, easy to use, good looking UI Templates, its a respected and well used library, and fully responsive out the box. 

3. Typescript - Typing components, functions and almost everything helps prevent my from making errors during development, also able to get autoComplete hints when I type. 

# Obstacles

At times there was some complexity with conflicting and mismatching types on component props, creating and reusing a type directory helps me to recognise and reuse types with ease. 

I found the iterative redux implimentation used along with decalring types for most moving parts of the codebase was quite time costly.

# Resources used

API Mocker -- https://mswjs.io/
UI Lib - Material UI
State Management - Redux + Redux Middleware

# If I had more time

I would improve the look and feel, integrated es-lint and used redux toolkit.

# Time spent

I spent 7h on the project, I added in some extras over and aboce the brief and I think one needs to take into account that I was using typescript to type check most of the codebase and redux, I would in future rather have used redux toolkit for faster development, presently I can say that my redux implimentation in light of turn around time could be improved. 

# Playing with the application. 

There is a lack of data on alot of the API deal items, lookup `Felix The Reaper` to get enough data to see all features functioning.
